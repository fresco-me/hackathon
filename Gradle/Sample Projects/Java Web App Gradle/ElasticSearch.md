## Support for ElasticSearch

### Prerequisites

We use the latest 6.x version of ElasticSearch (ES).

1. Download the ES server from [here](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
2. Follow the instructions to start it up.

### ES client

We use the high-level Rest client to contact the ES server from our code. Documentation is available [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high.html).

The new `Elastic` class has been introduced to drive the communication with the ES server. This class performs the following operations:

* Creates the ES index, if required. The name of the index is defined in the `app.properties` file. During the creation of the index, an appropriate mapping (ES term for document type) is also setup, to handle the geo_point data type. This is rather convenient, as you are able to delete the ES index at any time (using any ES method of choice, e.g. through `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/index`) and just restart the webapp to start over.
* Adds new events in the ES index.
* Provides the search entry-point (all searches are performed through a single method).

### Events

The sample code introduces an Event class to model the events of the project's domain. 

The Event model is not complete but it covers all the cases required (free-text, event attribute value, geo-distance).

The `DataAccess` class has been updated to support the following:

* the addition of a new event. The method inserts the event in the MySQL database, it retrieves its newly created id (auto-increment) and as a last step, it adds the event to ES, performing an appropriate transformation to its attributes.
* the execution of a search, calling the respective `Elastic.search` method.

### Rest endpoints

Two Rest endpoints have been added to the webapp to demonstrate and test the use of the above.

* `EventsResource`: Mapped to the `/events` endpoint, it can be used to create new events.
* `SearchResource`: Mapped to the `/search` endpoint, it can be used to perform searches.

#### Create new event through a Rest call
```
curl -d "place=PLID&title=T&description=D&subject=SID&tickets=NUM" -X POST http://localhost:8765/app/api/events
```
where:

* PLID: The id of an existing place (the geo-point data will be retrieved from this).
* T: the title of the event.
* D: the description of the event.
* SID: the id of an existing subject. Suppose that subjects are selected using a dropdown in the UI and thus a new subject table should be created in the database (yet the sample code does not include such functionality, you should add it).
* NUM: the number of available tickets.

#### Search for events with a Rest call
```
curl -d "text=TXT&subject=SID&latitude=LAT&longitude=LON&distance=D" -X POST http://localhost:8765/app/api/search
```

where:
* TXT: a free text.
* SID: the id of an existing subject.
* LAT, LON: The latitude / longitude of the user's point of interest (e.g. her home).
* D: the distance.

None of the above is mandatory: if no search fields are defined, the code will return all the events that have tickets available.

### Extend the code

Use the sample code as an example of the required search functionality and extend it to suit your project's needs. For example, the buy ticket operation should perform the required SQL queries in a single transaction and then update the ES event accordingly (e.g. set the value of the hasTickets boolean field).
