Configure Jenkins to build a Java application
---------------------------------------------------------
Your team is planning to use Jenkins Pipelines for their next project to build and test project code.
However, they are concerned about its Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment feature.
As a DevOps engineer, you are going to demonstrate to the team about the features and performance of a 
Jenkins Environment by creating a pipeline named JenkinsDemo that clones a java project from the git 
repository and execute the Java application.

Note:
