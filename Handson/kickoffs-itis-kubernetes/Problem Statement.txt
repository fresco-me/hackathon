Kickoffs - Web Application Deployment using Kubernetes
------------------------------------------------------

- Minikube is already installed in the environment.

- Start Minikube and run the following commands to sync host docker with minikube docker
    $ minikube -p minikube docker-env 
    $ eval $(minikube docker-env)

Getting started with the challenge,

- A homepage.html file is given in the path ~/Desktop/Project/kickoffs-itis-kubernetes
- Dockerize the given static html page into an image named 'homepage' which uses 'nginx' as base image.
- Create a Kubernetes deployment object named 'homepage-deployment' with 2 replicas which deploys the dockerized
homepage of an application on a container named 'web-homepage'. Add a label 'webapp' to the deployment object.
- Create a NodePort service named 'web-service' which exposes the deployment object on port 30112.
- Finally, check whether the application has been deployed and exposed on the specified NodePort.


Note:
- K8s deployment object should be created using 'homepage_deployment.yaml' file 
- K8s service should be created using 'web_service.yaml' file 
- Dockerfile, homepage_deployment.yaml and web_service.yaml should be present in the path ~/Desktop/Project/kickoffs-itis-kubernetes
