Alice is trying to solve two maven based challenges. Help Alice to complete the challenges as stated below
Challenge1
-----------
- This maven challenge is based on 3 maven modules named business, data and service.
(Note: Do not make any changes to the pre-existing structure of all the pom.xml files. There are some pre-defined java files in all the 3 modules and ensure that they are error-free by configuring respective pom.xml files as stated below)
1)Configure the parent pom of all the listed 3 modules

2)Configure the pom.xml file present in data folder such that it depends on business module and parent as root pom

3)Configure the pom.xml file present in business folder such that it depends on service module and parent as root pom

4)Configure the pom.xml file present in service folder such that it's parent is root pom

Challenge2
-----------
1. The scenario is based on configuring Parent and Child POM files such that child POM should be able to inherit all the required dependencies from Parent POM.

2. Configure ParentPOM to generate surefire report and checkstyle report

3. Configure ChildPOM to inherit all the dependencies/plugins from pom.xml in ParentPOM directory 

Note: No dependencies/plugins to be added in child pom.xml
