Before storing the credentials in jenkins, create a user in Tomcat with manager-script role.

To create users in Tomcat, open the file /var/lib/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml

> sudo vi /var/lib/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml

Go to end of the file and paste the following lines inside tomcat-users block and save it.

  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>

Here we have defined one role manager-script and created one user deployer and assigned the manager-script role to the deployer user.

Then restart the tomcat9

> sudo systemctl restart tomcat9
